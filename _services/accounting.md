**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the creation of machines capable of learning from data and generalizing their knowledge to handle new, unseen situations, allowing them to perform tasks without explicit programming. Over the past decade, this rapidly advancing field has increasingly influenced and reshaped numerous aspects of modern life.

# Major Risks 
1. Transformation of the Economy -> The rapid advancement of AI technologies poses a substantial risk of widespread job loss and redistribution, potentially rendering many careers obsolete while dramatically increasing the efficiency of workers in numerous fields. Additionally, as AI emerges as one of the most transformative technologies humanity has ever developed, it could trigger an arms race among nations and organizations. This evolution raises concerns about the concentration of power in the hands of those who control the most advanced AI systems—whether corporations or governments—potentially resulting in significant societal and economic imbalances.
2. Misinformation, unintended consequences, and bias -> AI can and has been adversarially utilized to increase the spread of disinformation and misinformation for economic or geopolitical gain. Additionally, even in an ecosystem with no malintent, like social media, where the algorithm exists just to spur engagement, it can increase violent, extreme, and wrong ideas increasing polarization and leading to political violence. Additionally, as AI is increasingly used to make decisions in these systems, and the data used to train these systems, contain inherent biases. 
3. Adversarial Agents -> As AI capabilities increase their ability to do a multitude of actions without human input will increase. This poses a significant risk as adversarial actors, or potentially even "rogue" AI can act in a way that harms society.
