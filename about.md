Here at the Center for Societal Risk (CSR), we have three primary goals: 

## 1. Enumerating Risks
Often one of the first steps for addressing risks is acknowledging that risk exists, so we seek to enumerate all the risks that threaten society. Additionally, we seek to improve the modeling, perception, and response to risky events, as we feel society is not only inadequately equipped to address risk tradeoffs but also has difficulty quantifying the risk of low-probability yet catastrophic events. 

## 2. Analyzing Impacts 
We seek to address all impacts of these risks, especially those second-order impacts and interactions that aren't always immediately apparent (for example how nuclear weapons can foster authoritarianism). Properly assessing the risk various issues pose (and equally important the risk they don't pose) can allow policymakers and leaders to make more informed decisions. 

## 3. Developing Responses
We seek to propose effective responses to each of these risks we enumerate and to also properly rebuke ineffective and harmful proposed responses. 

### Accomplishing our Goals 
We are committed to advancing our goals through the publication of comprehensive reports and scholarly papers that address these critical challenges and propose actionable solutions. In addition to these efforts we actively collaborate with academic institutions, industry leaders, think tanks, and policymakers to leverage diverse perspectives, embrace innovation, and ultimately make better decisions. These partnerships enable us to translate research findings into impactful policies and practical applications that address societal risks and promote resilience.
